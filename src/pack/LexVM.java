/************************************************************************************
 * LexVM - This class provides the driver for a lexical analyzer for tokens defined
 * in the following grammar:
 * 
 * <digit> 		  -> 0 | 1 | ... | 9
 * <unsigned int> -> { <digit> }+
 * <signed int>	  -> (+|-) { <digit> }+
 * <float>		  -> [+|-] ( { <digit> }+ "." { <digit> } | "." { <digit> }+ )
 * <floatE>		  -> <float> (e|E) [+|-] { <digit> }+
 * <instruction>  -> "iconst" | "iload" | "istore" | "fconst" | "fload" | "fstore" |
 *                  "iadd" | "isub" | "imul" | "idiv" | "fadd" | "fsub" | "fmul" | "fdiv" |
 *                  "intToFloat" | "icmpeq" | "icmpne" | "icmplt" | "icmple" | "icmpgt" |
 *                  "icmpge" |  "fcmpeq" | "fcmpne" | "fcmplt" | "fcmple" | "fcmpgt" | "fcmpge" | 
 *                  "goto" | "invoke" | "return" | "ireturn" | "freturn" | "print"
 * <colon> -> ":"
 * <comma> -> ","
 * 
 *  The lexical analyzer is implemented through a DFA that will accept the above tokens.
 *	The DFA states are represented by the Enum type State, located in file State.java
 *
 *  *** The DFA has the following states represented by enum-type literals ***
 *  
 *  A) Accepted states 
 *		STATE			ACCEPTS
 *		Colon			:
 *		Comma			,
 *		Id				Letters: a-z, A-Z
 *		SignedInt		Signed Integers
 *		UnsignedInt		Unsigned Integers
 *		Float			Float numbers without exponentiation
 *		FloatE			Float numbers with exponentiation
 *	
 *	A.1) If accept state is Id, then it is checked for following operator
 *		 states, also represented as enum-type literals:
 *		STATE			OPERATION
 *		iconst  		push integer constant
 *		iload  			push integer value from memory
 *		istore          pop value to memory
 *		fconst          push float constant
 *		fload  		    push float value from memory
 *		fstore          pop float value to memory
 *      iadd            addition of integers
 *      isub  			subtraction of integers
 *      imul  			multiplication of integers
 *      idiv  			division of integers
 *      fadd            addition of floats
 *      fsub  			subtraction of floats
 *      fmul            multiplication of floats
 *      fdiv            division of floats
 *      intToFloat      parse integer to float
 *      icmpeq          integer comparison for ==
 *      icmpne  		integer comparison for !=
 *      icmplt          integer comparison for <
 *      icmple  		integer comparison for <=
 *      icmpgt 			integer comparison for >
 *      icmpge   		integer comparison for >=
 *      fcmpeq  		float comparison for ==
 *      fcmpne  		float comparison for !=
 *      fcmplt  		float comparison for <
 *      fcmple  		float comparison for <=
 *      fcmpgt  		float comparison for >
 *      fcmpge  		float comparison for >=
 *      goto  			unconditional jump
 *      invoke  		method call
 *      return  	    void return
 *      ireturn         integer return
 *      freturn         float return
 *      print           print value
 *	
 *  B) Non-final states:
 *  	STATE			TOKEN
 *  	Start      		the empty string
		Period     		a float that starts with period
		E          		float ending with E or e
		EPlusMinus 		float ending with + or - in exponentiation part
		Plus			Signed float or integer starting with +
 *  	Minus			Signed float or integer starting with -
 *  
 *  C) The DFA has a undefined state denoted as State.UNDEF which signals that
 *     the current token generated an undefined transition.
 *		
 *
 *	Javadocs for the methods in LexVM.java and other classes can be found 
 *  on top of the class/enum declaration and over their method signatures
 *  
 *  ***************************** PLEASE READ ***************************************
 *  
 *  IMPORTANT: In order to allow for extra functionality when parsing, please
 *  read the comment on line 160 of State.java. Commenting out the mentioned block
 *  will allow for parsing of consecutive valid operators not separated by spaces.
 *  i.e iconstimulreturninvoke would be parsed as iconst imul return invoke. 
 *  Commenting out the block in State.java would, however, fail to pass the test
 *  for input file #2 provided because it has 'fconstt' as input. Commenting off
 *  the said block would parse this as Fconst for 'fconst' and invalid token for the last 't'.
 *  Since this does not match the expected output for input 2, the block was 
 *  commented off by default. To pass the "ultimate test" provided in file 
 *  input8.txt, please comment off the block on line 160 of State.java and compare it
 *  to expected8.txt file. 
 *  
 *      Parse safely :)
